This repository contains web sources scripts for Mp3tag that will allow you to use Apple Music or the iTunes Store to update music metadata. These web sources scripts for Mp3tag can automatically add tags to any song if that song is available on Apple Music and/or the iTunes Store. For these web sources scripts to work, the Apple Music or iTunes Store URL of a song is needed to retrieve the music metadata.

The web sources scripts in this repository include some modifications that were written by me. The original web sources scripts without any of my modifications can be located at a website called [Mp3tag Community](https://community.mp3tag.de/).
